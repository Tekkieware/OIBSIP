# OIBSIP
For my web designing and development internship at Oasis infobyte

 

 Created a full stack app using React, Django rest framework, and redux for State management.

1. Created an admin login and a user login with complete registration, authorization , and forgot password system. 

2. After logging in, users are able to view the available pizza varieties in the dashboard.

3. Users can start making the custom pizza by:

- Choosing any pizza base from 5 options.

- choosing any sauce from 5 options.

- Selecting a cheese type .

- choosing veggies from many options.

4. Integrated the razor pay checkout for payment with a dummy account in test mode. In test mode, on clicking success, place and confirm the order.

5. In the admin login, it has a mini inventory management system keeping track of available pizza base, sauce, cheese and veggies. 

6. After an order, the necessary changes in stock is updated and presented in the admin dashboard. 


7. Admin receives the order and change the status of the pizza- as order received, In the kitchen, and Sent to delivery.

8. For every update from the admin, the status change is reflected in the user dashboard.
